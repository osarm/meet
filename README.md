# Meet App
For my Meet App, I’ll be utilizing serverless functions to ensure the application remains highly responsive,
which is essential for its functionality. Serverless platforms automatically scale to meet demand, allowing the
app to efficiently manage high traffic loads. Since the app’s events are location-based, serverless functions
will seamlessly integrate geolocation services to match the user's location of interest. Additionally, serverless
functions will handle authentication through the Google Calendar API, ensuring smooth interaction with users' event data.
